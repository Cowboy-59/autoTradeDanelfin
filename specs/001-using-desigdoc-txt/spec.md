## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-24
- Q: Which risk calculation method should the system use? ‚Üí A: Both percentage of position size and fixed dollar amount
- Q: How should the system handle multiple simultaneous trade opportunities? ‚Üí A: Execute highest Danelfin score first, then others if funds remain; no trade if AI score < 9 for automated trading (unless user overrides with custom minimum)
- Q: What should be the trade history retention period? ‚Üí A: Indefinitely (no automatic deletion)
- Q: How should the system handle API unavailability? ‚Üí A: Pause automated trading, switch to manual mode, while retrying connections with exponential backoff in background
- Q: What should be the subscription price for platform access? ‚Üí A: 49 dollars per year

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a conservative trader, I want an automated trading platform that uses Danelfin's AI predictions and executes trades through Webull based on my risk parameters, so that I can participate in the market with controlled risk while maintaining my regular activities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the platform, **When** they complete registration with email, phone, and password, **Then** their account is created with secure hashed password storage
2. **Given** a registered user has configured their Stripe payment, **When** they activate their subscription, **Then** they gain access to the trading features
3. **Given** a user has set trading parameters (risk %, take profit %, alert %), **When** Danelfin identifies a trade opportunity within parameters, **Then** the system automatically initiates the trade on Webull
4. **Given** a trade is executed, **When** the position reaches the configured profit or loss threshold, **Then** the system closes the position and sends SMS/email notification
5. **Given** an admin user (admin@wxperts.com) logs in, **When** they access the management panel, **Then** they can view and manage all user profiles and trading data
6. **Given** a user selects paper trading mode, **When** trades are executed, **Then** the system simulates trades internally using real market data from Webull

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Danelfin or Webull API is unavailable? ‚Üí System pauses automated trading, switches to manual mode requiring user confirmation, and retries connections with exponential backoff in background
- How does system handle [insufficient funds for a trade]?
- What happens when multiple trade signals arrive simultaneously? ‚Üí System prioritizes by highest Danelfin AI score and executes sequentially until funds exhausted
- How does system respond when [market closes during an active trade]?
- What happens when [user's payment method fails]?
