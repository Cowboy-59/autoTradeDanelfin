## Template Guidelines

### Task Structure
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use numbered tasks with sub-tasks (1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 2.1, etc.)
- **Maximum Two Levels**: Keep hierarchy simple with main tasks and sub-tasks only
- **Checkbox Format**: All tasks must be checkboxes for tracking completion
- **Requirement References**: Each task should reference specific requirements

### Task Writing Best Practices

#### Task Descriptions
- **Actionable**: Each task should be something a developer can execute
- **Specific**: Avoid vague descriptions, be concrete about deliverables
- **Scoped**: Tasks should be completable in a reasonable timeframe
- **Testable**: Include how success will be measured

#### Task Categories
1. **Foundation/Setup**: Infrastructure, configuration, basic structure
2. **Core Implementation**: Main feature development
3. **Integration**: Connecting components and external systems
4. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, validation
5. **Polish**: Performance optimization, UX improvements, documentation

#### Task Details Format
```markdown
- [ ] X.X [Task Title]
  - [What needs to be implemented/built]
  - [Technical approach or constraints]
  - [Testing or validation requirements]
  - [Integration points or dependencies]
  - _Requirements: X.X, Y.Y, Z.Z_
```

### Coding-Focused Tasks Only
- **Include**: Writing code, creating tests, implementing features, building components
- **Exclude**: User testing, deployment, business processes, marketing activities
- **Focus**: Tasks that can be completed within the development environment

### Task Sequencing
- **Dependencies**: Earlier tasks should enable later tasks
- **Incremental**: Each task should build upon previous work
- **Testable**: Ensure tasks can be validated as they're completed
- **No Orphans**: All code should be integrated, no hanging implementations

### Requirement Traceability
- **Reference Format**: Use requirement numbers (e.g., _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3, 4.2_)
- **Coverage**: Ensure all requirements are covered by at least one task
- **Granularity**: Reference specific sub-requirements, not just user stories

### Example Task Patterns

#### Setup/Foundation Tasks
```markdown
- [ ] 1.1 Set up project structure and dependencies
  - Create directory structure following established patterns
  - Install and configure required packages and libraries
  - Set up build tools and development environment
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_
```

#### Implementation Tasks
```markdown
- [ ] 2.1 Implement user authentication service
  - Create authentication service with login/logout functionality
  - Implement JWT token generation and validation
  - Add password hashing and security measures
  - Write unit tests for authentication flows
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
```

#### Integration Tasks
```markdown
- [ ] 3.1 Integrate with external API service
  - Implement API client with proper error handling
  - Add retry logic and timeout configuration
  - Create integration tests for API endpoints
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_
```

#### Testing Tasks
```markdown
- [ ] 4.1 Create comprehensive test suite
  - Write unit tests for all service functions
  - Implement integration tests for API endpoints
  - Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows
  - _Requirements: All functional requirements_
```
