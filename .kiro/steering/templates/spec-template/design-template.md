# Design Document Template

## Overview

[Provide a comprehensive overview of the feature/module/application design. Include the purpose, scope, and how it fits into the larger system architecture.]

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
[Describe the overall system architecture, including major components and their relationships]

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: [Framework, libraries, tools]
- **Backend**: [Runtime, framework, database]
- **Infrastructure**: [Hosting, storage, external services]
- **Development**: [Build tools, testing frameworks]

### System Dependencies
- **Internal Dependencies**: [Other modules or components this depends on]
- **External Dependencies**: [Third-party services, APIs, libraries]

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. [Component Name]

**Purpose**: [What this component does and why it's needed]

**Key Interfaces**:
- `[InterfaceName]`: [Description of what this interface handles]
- `[ServiceName]`: [Description of service functionality]
- `[ControllerName]`: [Description of controller responsibilities]

**Database Tables** (if applicable):
- `[table_name]`: [Description of data stored]
- `[related_table]`: [Description and relationships]

### 2. [Component Name]

**Purpose**: [What this component does and why it's needed]

**Key Interfaces**:
- `[InterfaceName]`: [Description of functionality]
- `[ServiceName]`: [Description of service]

## Data Models

### Database Schema (if applicable)
```typescript
// Example schema definition
interface [EntityName] {
  id: string;
  [property]: [type];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### API Interfaces
```typescript
// Example API interface
interface [APIInterface] {
  [method]: ([parameters]) => Promise<[ReturnType]>;
}
```

### Data Flow
[Describe how data flows through the system, from input to storage to output]

## User Experience Design

### User Flows
1. **[Primary Flow Name]**: [Step-by-step user journey]
2. **[Secondary Flow Name]**: [Alternative user path]

### Interface Design
- **Layout**: [Description of page/screen layout]
- **Navigation**: [How users move through the interface]
- **Responsive Design**: [Mobile and desktop considerations]

### Accessibility Considerations
- [Screen reader compatibility]
- [Keyboard navigation]
- [Color contrast and visual design]

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
1. **[Error Type]**: [Description and handling approach]
2. **[Error Type]**: [Description and handling approach]

### Error Response Format
```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: any;
  };
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- [How users are authenticated]
- [Permission and role management]

### Data Protection
- [Sensitive data handling]
- [Encryption requirements]
- [Privacy compliance]

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Targets
- **Critical Operations**: [Target response time]
- **Standard Operations**: [Target response time]
- **Background Tasks**: [Acceptable processing time]

### Scalability Considerations
- [Expected load and growth]
- [Scaling strategies]

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- [What will be unit tested]
- [Testing framework and approach]

### Integration Testing
- [Integration points to test]
- [Testing scenarios]

### End-to-End Testing
- [User workflows to test]
- [Testing tools and approach]

---

## Template Guidelines

### Architecture Section
- Start with high-level overview, then drill down to specifics
- Include diagrams where helpful (Mermaid, system diagrams)
- Clearly define component boundaries and responsibilities

### Components and Interfaces
- Each component should have a clear, single responsibility
- Define interfaces that other components will use
- Consider both internal and external interfaces

### Data Models
- Include both database schema and API interfaces
- Show relationships between entities
- Consider data validation and constraints

### Error Handling
- Plan for both expected and unexpected errors
- Define consistent error response formats
- Consider user experience during error states

### Security and Performance
- Address security concerns early in design
- Set measurable performance targets
- Consider scalability from the beginning

### Testing Strategy
- Plan testing approach during design phase
- Consider different types of testing needed
- Define what success looks like for each test type
