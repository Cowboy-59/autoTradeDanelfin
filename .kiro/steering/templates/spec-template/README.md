# Spec Template

This template provides a standardized structure for creating feature specifications that can be used across any application or project.

## Template Structure

### 1. Requirements Document (`requirements-template.md`)
- **Purpose**: Define what needs to be built using user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Format**: EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- **Focus**: User needs, business logic, and functional requirements

### 2. Design Document (`design-template.md`)
- **Purpose**: Define how the feature will be architected and implemented
- **Focus**: Technical architecture, data models, user experience, and system design

### 3. Tasks Document (`tasks-template.md`)
- **Purpose**: Break down the design into actionable implementation tasks
- **Format**: Hierarchical checklist with requirement traceability
- **Focus**: Coding tasks that can be executed by developers

## How to Use This Template

### For New Features
1. Copy the template files to a new spec directory
2. Rename files (remove `-template` suffix)
3. Fill in the placeholders with feature-specific content
4. Follow the workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks

### Template Placeholders
- `[Feature Name]`: Replace with your specific feature name
- `[role]`: Replace with specific user roles (admin, user, guest, etc.)
- `[system]`: Replace with your application/system name
- `[Component Name]`: Replace with actual component names
- `[Description]`: Replace with detailed descriptions

### Workflow Process
1. **Requirements Phase**: Define user needs and acceptance criteria
2. **Design Phase**: Create technical architecture and user experience design
3. **Tasks Phase**: Break down into implementable coding tasks
4. **Implementation**: Execute tasks and track progress

## Best Practices

### Requirements Writing
- Use specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Focus on user value and business outcomes
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Reference external systems and integrations

### Design Documentation
- Start with high-level architecture, then drill down
- Define clear component boundaries and interfaces
- Consider security, performance, and scalability early
- Plan for testing and error handling

### Task Planning
- Create actionable, coding-focused tasks
- Ensure tasks build incrementally on each other
- Reference specific requirements for traceability
- Include testing and validation in each task

## Customization Guidelines

### Adapt for Your Domain
- Modify user roles to match your application
- Adjust technical stack references
- Include domain-specific requirements categories
- Add industry-specific compliance or security needs

### Scale for Project Size
- **Small Projects**: Combine some sections, focus on essentials
- **Large Projects**: Add more detailed subsections and cross-references
- **Enterprise**: Include additional governance and approval processes

### Team Collaboration
- Use the template as a starting point for team discussions
- Encourage iterative refinement of all documents
- Maintain traceability between requirements, design, and tasks
- Regular reviews and updates as understanding evolves

## Template Maintenance

This template should be updated based on:
- Lessons learned from using it across projects
- Changes in development practices and tools
- Feedback from development teams
- Evolution of requirements gathering techniques

The template is designed to be flexible and adaptable while providing consistent structure for feature development across any application domain.
