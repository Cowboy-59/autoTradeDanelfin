## Project Overview

\### .kiro/steering Documentation \*\*IMPORTANT\*\*: This project uses .kiro/steering folder for comprehensive project documentation. Always reference the markdown files in this folder for: - Detailed project specifications and requirements - Task breakdowns and development roadmap - UX improvements and feature implementations - Technical decisions and architectural guidance Check .kiro/steering/\*.md files before making any significant changes to understand the full context and requirements. ### .kiro/specs/current Amazon-style Specification System \*\*IMPORTANT\*\*: This project follows Amazon's spec-driven development methodology with structured specifications in .kiro/specs/ folder. Each spec contains: - \*\*requirements.md\*\*: Detailed functional requirements and specifications - \*\*design.md\*\*: Technical architecture, component design, and implementation approach - \*\*tasks.md\*\*: Task breakdown with direct references to requirements.md sections If there is an individual task in the selected spec folder, refer to the \`requirements.md\` file in that folder as mentioned in the task. Use \`design.md\` for overall context or when necessary. When instructed to work on task from task.md file, mark the task completed in the document once it has been completed The .kiro/specs/current folder is the current specification folder for the feature currently being worked on. It is the most important folder for understanding the project's current state and development progress. The .kiro/specs/completed folder contains specifications for completed features. It is used to track the history of completed features and their specifications. ## CRITICAL .kiro/specs Folder (Amazon-style Specifications) \*\*IMPORTANT\*\*: This project follows Amazon's spec-driven development methodology with structured specifications in .kiro/specs/ folder. Each spec contains: - \*\*requirements.md\*\*: Detailed functional requirements and specifications - \*\*design.md\*\*: Technical architecture, component design, and implementation approach - \*\*tasks.md\*\*: Task breakdown with direct references to requirements.md sections \*\*Current Work\*\*: The .kiro/specs/current folder contains the specification for the feature currently being worked on. When instructed to work on a task from tasks.md file: 1. Refer to the \`requirements.md\` file in that folder as mentioned in the task 2. Use \`design.md\` for overall context when necessary 3.
